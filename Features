Let me explain the key innovations and features of this system:

1. Architecture Overview:
- The system uses zero-knowledge proofs to allow selective disclosure of identity attributes while maintaining privacy
- A master secret serves as the root of trust for all credentials
- Biometric authentication is integrated using commitment schemes
- A privacy-preserving revocation system prevents abuse of revoked credentials

2. Novel Technical Features:

The credential system introduces several cutting-edge capabilities:

- Selective Attribute Disclosure: Users can prove specific attributes (age, citizenship) without revealing the actual values
- Biometric Integration: Uses commitment schemes to integrate biometric authentication without storing actual biometric data
- Cross-Credential Linking Prevention: The master secret prevents unauthorized credential linking
- Privacy-Preserving Revocation: Implements a cryptographic accumulator for efficient revocation checks without revealing individual credentials

3. Implementation Innovations:

- Dynamic Circuit Generation: The system generates specialized zero-knowledge circuits for different verification scenarios
- Flexible Attribute Structure: Supports complex nested attributes while maintaining privacy
- Temporal Validity: Includes timestamp-based validity proofs for all credentials
- Quantum-Resistant Features: The architecture allows for upgrade paths to post-quantum cryptographic primitives
