Healthcare, Social Benefits, and Passport Credentials interact through several sophisticated mechanisms while maintaining privacy and security. Here's a detailed explanation of their integration:

Core Integration Layer

The components share a foundational integration through the master secret, which serves as the root of trust. This integration enables several key features:

1. Unified Identity Verification
Each component inherits from the base IdentityCredential class, allowing them to generate proofs that demonstrate the holder controls the master secret. This enables unified verification without compromising privacy or revealing cross-component information.

2. Shared Attribute Management
The components can securely reference common attributes while maintaining data minimization principles. For example, a proof of residency verified through the Passport component can be used by the Social Benefits component without duplicating the verification process.

Cross-Component Verification Mechanisms

The system implements several sophisticated cross-component verification patterns:

1. Composite Proofs
When multiple credentials are required, the system can generate composite zero-knowledge proofs that combine attributes from different components. For instance, proving healthcare coverage eligibility might require:
- Residency status (Passport)
- Income verification (Social Benefits)
- Medical history (Healthcare)

2. Eligibility Cascades
The components implement an eligibility cascade system where verification in one component can automatically trigger eligibility checks in others. For example:
- A verified refugee status in the Passport component might automatically initiate healthcare coverage verification
- Proof of disability in the Healthcare component could trigger social benefits eligibility verification

Privacy-Preserving Data Sharing

The components maintain strict privacy controls while enabling necessary information sharing:

1. Selective Disclosure
Each component implements specialized selective disclosure protocols that allow sharing specific attributes without revealing others. For example, the Healthcare component can prove insurance coverage status to the Social Benefits component without revealing medical history.

2. Emergency Access Integration
The Healthcare component's emergency access mechanism integrates with the Passport component's identity verification system, allowing emergency responders to verify both identity and medical information through a single proof.

Temporal Validity and Revocation

The components share a unified approach to temporal validity and revocation:

1. Synchronized Validity Periods
When one component's credentials are revoked or expire, the system can automatically trigger validity checks across other components. For instance, if a passport is revoked, the system can initiate a review of associated healthcare and social benefits credentials.

2. Cross-Component Revocation
The RevocationRegistry is shared across components, enabling coordinated revocation when necessary while maintaining privacy. Each component can verify the validity of credentials from other components without learning specific revocation reasons.

Future Extensibility

The system is designed for future expansion through:

1. Modular Architecture
New components can be added without modifying existing ones, thanks to the standardized interface for credential verification and proof generation.

2. Upgradeable Cryptography
The system supports upgrading cryptographic primitives independently for each component while maintaining cross-component compatibility.

This integration architecture ensures that the components work together seamlessly while maintaining strong privacy guarantees and security properties. Each interaction is mediated through zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring that only the minimum necessary information is shared between components.
